# CSS Selector Transforms

Because Lift operates by transforming HTML trees, it needs an easy way to
specify those transformations. Otherwise we'd be doing a bunch of recursive
tree searches and munges and it would get ugly and probably slow to boot. To
deal with transformations easily, we use a small subset of CSS selectors, with
a few Lift idiosyncrasies to maximize performance and address some use cases
that are particularly useful when transforming trees.

We'll leave forms for the next section, as forms always come with a catalog of
related functionality, and focus on binding the list of chat messages in this
section. We'll also add a new one before every page load, so that we can see
the list changing.

First, we'll define a variable to hold the messages:

```
...
object Chat {
  var messageEntries = List[String]()
...
}
```

Then, we can change the definition of the `messages` method to bind the
contents of the message list:

```
...

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

...
  def messages = {
    "li *" #> messageEntries
  }
...
```

In the previous section, we mentioned that Lift snippets can return
`(NodeSeq)=>NodeSeq` functions. That is what's happening here: Lift's CSS
selector transforms are actually functions that take a `NodeSeq` and return a
`NodeSeq`, constructed using an easy-to-read syntax.

What we do in this particular transformation is select all ``li``s. We then
specify that we want to transform them by replacing their contents (`*`) by
whatever is on the right. The right side, however, is a list, in this case of
``String``s. When there's a list on the right side of a transformation, Lift
repeats the matched element or elements once for each entry in the list, and
binds the contents of each element in turn.

Let's start up Lift and see what's going on. In your terminal, enter the
directory of the chat app and start up the application:

```
$ sbt
> container:start
[info] Compiling 4 Scala sources to /Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/target/scala-2.9.2/classes...
[info] jetty-8.1.7.v20120910
[info] NO JSP Support for /, did not find org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet
[info] started o.e.j.w.WebAppContext{/,[file:/Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/src/main/webapp/]}
[info] started o.e.j.w.WebAppContext{/,[file:/Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/src/main/webapp/]}
[info] Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
[success] Total time: 4 s, completed Oct 6, 2013 2:31:01 PM
>
```

Once you see the success message, point your browser to
`http://localhost:8080/`. You should see an empty chat list, since currently
there are no message entries. To fix this, we're going to add a chat message
every time we render the message list:

```
...
  def messages = {
    messageEntries :+= "It is now " + formattedTimeNow
    "li *" #> messageEntries
  }
...
```

Let's recompile and restart the server:

```
> container:stop
[info] stopped o.e.j.w.WebAppContext{/,[file:/Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/src/main/webapp/]}
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Oct 6, 2013 2:36:48 PM
> container:start
[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/target/scala-2.9.2/classes...
[info] jetty-8.1.7.v20120910
[info] NO JSP Support for /, did not find org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet
[info] started o.e.j.w.WebAppContext{/,[file:/Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/src/main/webapp/]}
[info] started o.e.j.w.WebAppContext{/,[file:/Users/Shadowfiend/github/lift-example/src/main/webapp/]}
[info] Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
```

Now if you pull up the page you'll see something that doesn't look quite right.
The markup we're producing should look something like:

```
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
```

If you reload the page, you'll get something like:

```
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:25 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:26 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:26 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:26 UTC</li>
      <li>It is now 13:26 UTC</li>
```

What's causing all the repetition? Well, remember when we described what the
CSS Selector Transform was doing, we said we “select all ``li``s”. We also said
that the list on the right side means “Lift repeats the matched element **or
elements**”. So we select all the ``li``s, but in the template there are 4, so
that the template when viewed alone (say, for a user test, or when a frontend
developer is editing it) has some content in it. How do we bridge the two
without getting nasty in our HTML?

Lift lets us tag the extra elements with a class `clearable`:

```
...
      <li>Hi!</li>
      <li class="clearable">Oh, hey there.</li>
      <li class="clearable">How are you?</li>
      <li class="clearable">Good, you?</li>
...
```

Then, in our snippet, we can use a special transform called `ClearClearable`,
which will remove all of the tagged elements before we start transforming the
template:

```
...
import net.liftweb.util.ClearClearable
...
  def messages = {
    messageEntries :+= "It is now " + formattedTimeNow

    ClearClearable &
    "li *" #> messageEntries
  }
...
```

Notice that we combine the two CSS selector transforms here by using `&`. You
can chain together as many CSS selector transforms as you want this way, as long
as they don't modify the same parts of the same element. We'll deal with that
limitation link:13-who-knows[a little later] footnote:[This is because CSS
selector transforms are optimized for speed, and pass through the nodes a
single time to make all of the transformations happen.].

Now if we restart the server and look at the results, we'll see the right thing
happening: one entry per message, and every time we reload the page we get a
new entry.

Now that we've got the list of messages rendering, it's time to get into the
bread and butter of web development: link:5-basic-forms.adoc[forms].
